# Hey there! ✨

*I'm a coding enthusiast  building apps & websites with a mission to make the world a better place.  Currently diving into the wonderful world of JavaScript  and always up for a challenge.  I embrace my inner dork  (and maybe a sprinkle of ADHD ⚡) so expect some fun side projects along the way.*

**Absolute AI Maniac!  If something can be automated or improved with AI, I will improve it.**

**Feel free to hit me up on GitHub if you have any questions or cool ideas! (But heads up, emails might get lost in the black hole that is my inbox.)**
